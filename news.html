			<h5 id="NewsInfo" >2-09-2016</h5>
			<p id="News Text" >
				Apologies for the giant lack of progress updates and news. As we have gotten closer to bag and tag day, 
				more and more information has been confidential. However, now that we are really close to bag and tag, 
				we feel that it would be okay to release more info in interest of our supporters and team friends. So, 
				in bulk, we have done a lot in terms of progress. As of me writing this, we have assembled the chassis, 
				and tested our ball intake and firing systems extensively. We have also started to secure components on 
				our electronics plate. Teleoperated Code is completed in Java, and we are on the verge of creating a few 
				autonomous programs. Below are some of the photos of the last few weeks. More to come tomarrow.

				Today we deployed our first code to the robot, to test the spinning of the treads. 
				At first one spun much faster than the other, but then we fine tuned them to be in sync. 
				Tomorrow we plan on adding turning and a ball infeed.

				Snow days do not stop us. Also, tank treads came in! We are working on not only building them, 
		but also the Sally Port. The Cheval de Frise is finished. We also started plans on the Drawbridge.

				Over the past week, we have:
				<ul class="InvisBulletPoints">
					<li>Built the Rough Terrain</li>
					<li>Worked on CAD</li>
					<li>Built the Low Bar</li>
					<li>Built the Moat</li>
					<li>Built the Rock Wall</li>
					<li>Built the Ramparts</li>
					<li>Started the Chival de Frise</li>
					<li>Started the Sally Port</li>
					<li>Tidied up the website</li>
					<li>Worked on a prototype ball infeed / shooter</li>

			<h2 id="NewsTitle" >Testing Ball Shooting Capacity</h2>
			<h5 id="NewsInfo" >1-22-2016</h5>
			<p id="News Text" >
				Today we headed over to Rexair to test the abilities of motors firing a ball. With our previous design, 
				we were on a 10 : 1 gearbox, and the ball shot out about as fast as a horse drawn carriage walking 
				through a molasses <b>moat.</b> So, purely to test the revolutions needed, we created a chute for the 
				ball to travel out of cardboard, gutted the inside of some vacuums, and spun them up to 6,000 RPM. As 
				you can see In the video, the ball definitely shoots.

				Today we started work on a ball intake system for our robot. We also continued work on the 
				Cheval de Frise. Ball intake is going well, but we are swapping gearboxes because It doesnâ€™t 
				quite have the speed we want.

				We finished the ramparts today. Again, we have no tank treads. However, construction on the Cheval de 
				Frise has begun, as well as the Sally Port. We also worked on gearboxes. CAD is ever closer. Website 
				team (All of me, myself, and I) have coded the following segment to add a countdown to the homepage.

				Today we finished the Low bar, Moat, and Rock Wall. We also started work on the ramparts. 
				Still no sign of tank treads :( . Code and Build teams are waiting. CAD is getting closer. 
				We also worked on some website things, fonts and colors!

			<h5 id="NewsInfo" >1-18-2016</h5>
			<p id="News Text" >
				Today we worked a lot on building defences. We finished our rough terrain, and started work on the moat. 
				We are currently waiting for the tank treads to come in, then we will start work on the Robot. Some of 
				us worked on CAD designs or coding. Overall, we would like to have 2-3 more defences done tomorrow.

			<h2 id="NewsTitle" >Designing CAD</h2>
			<h5 id="NewsInfo" >1-15-2016</h5>
			<p id="News Text" >
				We have drawn up our designs for the robot by hand on paper and whiteboard over the past few days, 
				now it is time for us to CAD them up. We are currently building our model defences and testing the 
				roboRIO (We had a problem with this "Robot Brain" from last year). A few days ago we ordered our parts 
				(Tank treads), and will start building as soon as they come in. Expect weekday progress reports from 
				here on out!

			<p id="News Text" >
				Our team is ramping up for the kickoff! We are planning on beginning work on our robot on kickoff day,
				and working for 4-5 hours per day, every week day, for the six week build session. Today we worked
				on cleaning up our working space in the Junior High.
