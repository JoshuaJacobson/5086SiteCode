		<p>
			We are the Cadillac Connectors - Team 5086. We are a relativly new team to first robotics, starting in the 2014 season with our wonderful sponsors and mentors. Most of us attend Cadillac High School, in Cadillac, Michigan. We have the great opportunity to not only learn STEM and the benifits of Science and Math, but also buisiness opportunities - From talking to sponsors to building this website! Each year, in January, we recive from FIRST a kit of supplies and an animation of this year's game and the rules/objectives. Then, we have six weeks to design, build, code, test, debug, and practice with our robot. After that, we bag up the robot and go to competitions!

		<p>
			So, you may be asking why we, a team dedicated to building a robot, would need sponsors? Well, let us tell you! A big part of FIRST is working with the community, that's even where our team name from. However, not only is connecting wilth the community a part of FIRST, but sponsorships in particular are the main way that we finance the team. Without your help, there would be no Cadillac Connectors! So, if you want to help the team and become a part of the community, sponsor us!
